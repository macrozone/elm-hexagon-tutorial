# Elm Game Tutorial

In this tutorial we are going to create a game in elm. The game is based on 
Terry Cavanagh's great arcade game http://terrycavanaghgames.com/hexagon/[Hexagon].

When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
