Project Setup
=============

Create a new folder for the project and `cd` into it.

Every Elm project needs an `elm-package.json` file. This is similar to the node package.json file.
It holds all meta information about the project. Copy and paste the following content:

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbaechler/polygon/master/elm-package.json" %}{% endcodesnippet %}
