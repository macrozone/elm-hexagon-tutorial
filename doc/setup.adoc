Project Setup
=============

Create a new folder for the project and `cd` into it.

Every Elm project needs an `elm-package.json` file. This is similar to the node package.json file.
It holds all meta information about the project. Copy and paste the following content:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "summary": "A functional reactive implementation of Terry Cavanagh's game Hexagon in Elm",
    "repository": "https://github.com/sbaechler/polygon.git",
    "license": "All rights reserved",
    "source-directories": [
        "src",
        "lib/elm-audio/src"
    ],
    "exposed-modules": [],
    "native-modules": true,
    "dependencies": {
        "elm-lang/animation-frame": "1.0.0 <= v < 2.0.0",
        "elm-lang/core": "4.0.0 <= v < 5.0.0",
        "elm-lang/html": "1.0.0 <= v < 2.0.0",
        "elm-lang/window": "1.0.0 <= v < 2.0.0",
        "evancz/elm-graphics": "1.0.0 <= v < 2.0.0",
        "ohanhi/keyboard-extra": "1.0.1 <= v < 2.0.0"
    },
    "elm-version": "0.17.0 <= v < 0.18.0"
}
----

Create a folder `src` and in it the main file `Hexagon.elm`.
Create another folder `lib` for later use.

Run the command `elm-package install` to install the dependencies. Run the server with
`elm-reactor`.
