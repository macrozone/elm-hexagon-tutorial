Wrap Up

That's all, folks! We hope you enjoyed writing a simple game in Elm. Feel free to optimize it and
play around with the code.

Elm is still a work in progress and the API is most likely going to change. The ecosystem around
the language should grow and the tools improve.

If you ever get stuck when writing your program, you can ask for help in the Elm https://elmlang.slack.com[Slack channel].
There is always someone there to help.
