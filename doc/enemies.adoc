Enemies
-------

In the original game the shape of the enemies are defined in a large class and they are created in waves. For this tutorial we keep it simpler. We have some pre-defined enemie-arrangements that repeat.

Let's first introduce a new type `Enemy`:

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/enemies/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="26:30", language="elm" %}{% endcodesnippet %}


* radius: the distance of the enemies to the center
* parts: a list of true/false that indicate where the enemy has a "hole"

We add a list of enemies to the game state as well as `enemySpeed` which will increase over time and define a constant value `enemyThickness`.
