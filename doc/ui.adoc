UI
--

Up next are the UI elements: The text messages at the beginning and end of the game and the
clock at the top left of the screen. We also add a pause state.

We need two more imports:

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/ui/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="11:12" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

Two new states are added to the State type: `Starting` and `Pause`. `Starting` is needed to reset
the counter and to cue the music later on.

## UI elements

There are two UI elements in the game: The clock at the upper left corner and the status display
and help text in the center of the screen.

The start message is a constant and therefore defined with the models:

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/ui/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="59:59" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

We need a helper function to transform the string to an `Element` type. The function is going to format
the text as well. The first argument of the function is the font size, the second argument the text
string.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/ui/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="286:292" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

Another helper function is needed to display the clock. The input is a `Time` value that is created
by the timestamp function. This is the reason why we wrap the input signal with a timestamp.

The clock should display the time in steps of 1/100th of a second. We therefore create three variables:
`centiseconds` is a helper variable to hold the 1/100th of a second value. +
`seconds` uses an integer division to divide the centiseconds and cut off the sub-seconds. +
`centis` uses a modulo function to keep only the sub-seconds. +
The `padLeft` method pads the number with zeroes.

The view function is now extended to use the UI elements.

The `score` value is going to show the time that has passed. +
The value of the `message` box depends on the state of the game. It is either "Game Over",
"Pause" or empty.

The `toForm` method turns an `Element` into a `Form` object. That way it can be modified later on.
In our case it is moved to the correct position on the screen.

## Pause
We have to add the two new states to the `updateState` method. The Starting state is only used
to reset the counters and after that is automatically transitioned to the `Play` state.

When the user presses the space bar the game should pause.

We are already adding a stub for the `isGameOver` method here. In the next chapter we are going to add
collision detection. Until then the method just returns False.

The `updatePlayer` function is modified so that the ship is only moved when the game is running.
