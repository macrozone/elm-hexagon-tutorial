Music and Bass Shake[[music]]
-----------------------------

In Hexagon, the music is an important element of the game. It is even part of the game mechanics:
Whenever there is a bass sequence, the whole stage is shaking.

The original game music is copyrighted. Therefore we provide an alternative track
for this tutorial that has a Creative Commons license.

There is an issue with Safari, so use a different Browser for this.

## Download the Music
The track that we are going to use is called "Shiny Tech" by Kevin MacLeod.
Download it from the
http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?collection=12&page=1[Incompetech] website.

Rename it to `shinytech.mp3` and copy it into a `src/music` folder.

---

If you live in a country where it is allowed to download copyrighted material
for private use, such as in Switzerland, then you can actually use the original
track.
Download the Hexagon SWF file from http://terrycavanaghgames.com/hexagon/hexagon.swf[here]
and unzip it. (On a Mac, just double-click the file.)
The music is the file "Sound 11".
Rename the downloaded file to "music.mp3" and copy it into the music folder.

## Install the audio library
The audio library abstracts the HTML5 Audio tag for the elm language. It uses native bindings.
Unfortunately Elm discourages the use of native bindings for 3rd party libraries. But until audio
support is available in core we have to use one.

It is not possible to install such libraries through elm-package. So we have to use git
or download it ourselves. We copy the `elm-audio` library in a folder called `lib/elm-audio`.

The easiest way is to do this with git. Create the folder `lib` in your project directory.
Then clone the git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/xarvh/elm-audio.git lib/elm-audio

If you are already using git for this tutorial, then you can add it as a submodule:

    git submodule add https://github.com/xarvh/elm-audio.git lib/elm-audio

This is not enogh though. Elm expects the native module to be named after the package.
So open the file `elm-audio/src/Native/Audio.js` and change the name of the global function
to match the name that you gave your project in `elm-package.json` in the `repository` field.
It uses the syntax `_<username>$<project>$Native_Audio`.

While we are here, we can add a few strategic console.log statements for debugging:
 * Inside the `oncanplaythrough()` method which fires when the audio has been loaded completely
 * Inside the `playSound` and `stopSound` method.


## Cue the music

Import the audio and the task module:

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="14:15" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

The music should play when the game state is `Play` and pause for all other
states. The music should restart at the beginning whenever a game is
restarted. This means we have to cue the audio whenever a game is restarted.

Therefore we have to create a few more states. Those states are short-lived. They
are only used to cue our side-effect tasks that start and stop the music.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

The reference to the music object has to be added to the model, our Game object. Because it is the
result of a Task, it might have failed. So the music property is an optional `Maybe Sound` type.
Add a `hasBass : Bool` property as well.

The music property is initialized with the value `Nothing` in the `init` method. `hasBass` is set to
`False`.

The loading of the music file is a Task as well. It sends of the message `MusicLoaded` when the
mp3 has been downloaded (When the browser has fired the `canplaythrough` event).
The task could also fail, therefore we add an `Error` message. A `Noop`
message is needed as well as a callback for the stop command.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

[source,elm]
----
loadSound : Task String Sound
loadSound = Audio.loadSound "music/music.mp3"
----

The audio library exposes a `Sound` type wich is a reference to a HTML5 Audio tag. The
`PlaybackOptions` object has three attributes: Volume, start and loop.

We set loop to True and startAt to Nothing, which means that it continues playing from its current
position.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

The `playSound` and `stopSound` functions start and stop the music. They take a reference to the
sound object and an options object and return a command of type message.

They are tasks because playing audio is a side-effect. In case of an error, the Error message is
sent. In case of success (the audio is done playing) the Noop message is sent.
We use anonymous functions to define the callbacks.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

With all the new states the update methods become a bit more complex. However, it is still
easily readable and understandable.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

We add the new intermediate helper states. In the `onUserInput` function, update the `nextState`
assignment so it uses the new states.

In the `onFrame` function we are going to output new commands as well, so we assign those in the
`let` block. At first we have to make sure, that the music is not `Nothing`. (It won't compile if
this check was missing.) +
In the `Starting` state the music is played from the beginning. The `startAt` value is a `Maybe` as
well so we have to use `Just 0` here.
The other states should be self-explanatory.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

The update method needs to handle the new states. When the `MusicLoaded` message arrives,
the game state is set to `NewGame` and the music is stored in the model. +
In case of an error we just throw it.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

Finally we have to load the audio file in the init method. We use `Cmd.batch` to queue multiple
commands.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="24:24" %}{% endcodesnippet %}



## Bass pump
The playing field should pump in sync with the beat. Therefore we have to define
the speed of the track and the sections where there is a bass part.

Add three variables for beat, amplitude and phase:

[source,elm]
----
beat = 138.0 |> bpm
beatAmplitude = 0.06
beatPhase = 270 |> degrees
----

The original music requires slightly different values:

[source,elm]
----
beat = 130.0 |> bpm
beatAmplitude = 0.06
beatPhase = 180 |> degrees
----

Phase lets you adjust the start of the pumping so it matches the music exactly.

The beat is given in bpm which has to be calculated first using this function:

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="72:74" %}{% endcodesnippet %}


We have already added a `hasBass : Bool` property to the Game model and `hasBass = False`
to the defaultGame object.

Next we add a function `hasBass` that takes a time value and returns `True` if there
is a bass passage or `False` otherwise.

[source,elm]
----
hasBass : Time -> Bool
hasBass time =
  if time < 20894 then False
  else if time < 41976 then True
  else if time < 55672 then False
  else if time < 67842 then True
  else if time < 187846 then False
  else if time < 215938 then True
  else False
----

For the original track use those values:

[source,elm]
----
hasBass time =
  if time < 14760 then False
  else if time < 44313 then True
  else if time < 51668 then False
  else if time < 129193 then True
  else if time < 14387 then False
  else True
----

The hasBass value is set in the `update` method:

  { game |
  ...
  , hasBass = Music.hasBass game.msRunning


The `beatPulse` method takes the game state and returns a function that goes
from Form -> Form.
The input is the playing field. The output is either the same or the pulsating playing field.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="14:21" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

The `pump` method calculates the value that is passed to the scale method using
a sin function. +
The input is the game progress (an Int). The `sin` function returns a value
between -1 and 1 so we are multiplying it with
`beatAmplitude` to specify how much the stage should shake. +
The `beatPhase` value is used to adjust the timing so it matches with the music.

{% codesnippet "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/chapter/music/src/Hexagon.elm", lines="14:21" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

The center hole is always pulsating but it should be in sync with the rest of the
stage during a bass sequence. For that we adjust the `makeCenterHole` function.
Whenever there is a bass sequence the radius of the center piece should remain constant
otherwise it should be pumping.
