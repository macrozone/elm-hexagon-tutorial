Elm Game Tutorial
-----------------

Written by Simon BÃ¤chler and Marco Wettstein

In this tutorial we are going to create a game in elm. The game is based on
the great arcade game http://terrycavanaghgames.com/hexagon/[Hexagon].
That game was the prototype for the successful mobile game Super Hexagon.

The tutorial requires some knowledge of the concepts of functional programming.
You should also have read the section about
http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/index.html[the Elm architecture]. The game is building
upon this and uses the Model-Update-View pattern.

This is an intermediate-level tutorial. The final program is about 434 lines of code.

It is based on Elm 0.17, which uses a different approach than 0.16. In fact we were almost done with
the tutorial when 0.17 came out and dropped Signals in favor of Commands. So we decided to
rewrite everything to be 0.17 compliant and use the new architecture.

The ecosystem is not complete yet and the move to a new API broke a few useful tools like the Elm
debugger.

While Elm is currently only compiling to Javascript this might change in the future. That's why
it is not possible anymore to have external libraries that use native bindings such as the Web audio API.
Until Elm core supports this we are going to have to work around this limitation (as you will
see in chapter <<doc/music.adoc#music,Music>>).

The tutorial is is split up in seven chapters, each with a special focus. By the end of each
chapter you will have a running program.

You can check out the full source code of each chapter:
https://github.com/macrozone/elm-hexagon-tutorial/blob/chapter/controls/src/Hexagon.elm[here]. Each
chapter has its own branch.

The authors wish to thank Terry Cavanagh for letting us use his game for this tutorial.
